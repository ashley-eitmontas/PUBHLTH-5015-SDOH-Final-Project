# PUBHLTH 5015 Final Project: Social Determinants of Health

Ashley Eitmontas' and Ella Anderson's final project for PUBHLTH 5015 (Dr. Rempala).

## Project Overview:

This repository contains the final project for PUBHLTH 5015 (Dr. Rempala).

Our analysis explores the relationship between social determinants of health (SDOH) such as insurance coverage, median household income, educational attainment, poverty rates, and unemployment rates and asthma prevalence outcomes. Using public health datasets, we analyze disparities, visualize geographic patterns, and interpret findings in the context of community health. The goal is to demonstrate how data analysis can inform public health policy and community interventions.

## Repository Structure:

-   `data/` → Raw datasets used in the analysis.
-   `scripts/` → R scripts for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.
-   `results/` → Output files (e.g., regression results, CSVs).
-   `figs/` → Figures and maps generated during analysis.
-   `docs/` → Final report (`report.Rmd`) and knitted outputs (PDF/HTML).

## Reproducibility

To reproduce the analysis:

1.  Clone this repository: <https://github.com/ashley-eitmontas/PUBHLTH-5015-SDOH-Final-Project.git>
2.  Open the project in RStudio using the `.Rproj` file.
3.  Install required R packages.
4.  Knit `docs/report.Rmd` to generate the final report.
5.  **Note:** File paths use `here::here()` to ensure reproducibility from the project root.

## Deliverables:

-   **Data Cleaning:** Scripts in `scripts/` prepare datasets for analysis.

-   **Analysis:** Regression models and descriptive statistics saved in `results/`.

-   **Figures:** Maps and plots in `figs/`.

-   **Report:** Final narrative and interpretation in `docs/report.Rmd`.

## Interpretation:

The report discusses:

-   Key findings on asthma prevalence, poverty, and household income.

-   How asthma prevalence is linked to social determinants of health.

-   Policy implications for addressing health disparities in U.S. communities.
